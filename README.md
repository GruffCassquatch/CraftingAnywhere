# Crafting Anywhere
Allows you to remove the location requirements from craftable items (eg workbench). 

Individual settings for each craftable item so you can pick and choose. 

Note that each item can only have ONE crafting location (this is a base game limitation). If you set the crafting location to Anywhere, the item will no longer show up in the crafting menu for the usual location (e.g. when using a workbench).

No other crafting requirements are changed! For example, you still need a Heavy Hammer to craft Arrowheads.

Supports items from: [BetterWaterManagement](https://github.com/ds5678/Better-Water-Management), [BlanketMod](https://github.com/ds5678/BlanketMod), [CanneryManufacturing](https://github.com/ds5678/CanneryManufacturing), [ClothingPack](https://github.com/ds5678/Clothing-Pack), [NorthfolkClothingPack](https://github.com/HAHAYOUDEAD/NorthfolkClothingPack), [WolfskinScarf](https://github.com/Atlas-Lumi/TLD-WolfskinScarf)
